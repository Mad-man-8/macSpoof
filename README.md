# macSpoof
Spoof your mac address
The name of your wireless interface is most probably wlan0. If it isn't wlan0, open the spoof.sh dile with nano and replace 'wlan0' with the name of your wireless interface. If you don't know your wireless interface's name, you can check it with the command,

sudo lshw -c network

in front of 'logical name:' you'll see your wireless interface's name.
